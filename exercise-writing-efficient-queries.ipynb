You have enough time to write working versions of all three, but only enough time to think about optimizing one of them.  Which of these queries is most worth optimizing?\n\n1. A software engineer wrote an app for the shipping department, to see what items need to be shipped and which aisle of the warehouse to go to for those items. She wants you to write the query. It will involve data that is stored in an `orders` table, a `shipments` table and a `warehouseLocation` table. The employees in the shipping department will pull up this app on a tablet, hit refresh, and your query results will be shown in a nice interface so they can see what costumes to send where.\n\n\n2. The CEO wants a list of all customer reviews and complaints… which are conveniently stored in a single `reviews` table. Some of the reviews are really long… because people love your pirate costumes for parrots, and they can’t stop writing about how cute they are.\n\n\n3. Dog owners are getting more protective than ever. So your engineering department has made costumes with embedded GPS trackers and wireless communication devices. They send the costumes’ coordinates to your database once a second. You then have a website where owners can find the location of their dogs (or at least the costumes they have for those dogs). For this service to work, you need a query that shows the most recent location for all costumes owned by a given human. This will involve data in a `CostumeLocations` table as well as a `CostumeOwners` table.\n\nSo, which of these could benefit most from being written efficiently?  Set the value of the `query_to_optimize` variable below to one of `1`, `2`, or `3`.  (Your answer should have type **integer**.)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fill in your answer\nquery_to_optimize = 3\n\n# Check your answer\nq_1.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-13T06:29:51.989163Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-13T06:29:51.989707Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-13T06:29:52.002823Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-13T06:29:51.989664Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-13T06:29:52.001084Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"outcomeType\": 1, \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.5, \"interactionType\": 1, \"questionType\": 1, \"questionId\": \"1_PetCostumes\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\"}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Correct: \n\n\n`query_to_optimize = 3`\n\nWhy **3**: Because data is sent for each costume at each second, this is the query that is likely to involve the most data (by far).
